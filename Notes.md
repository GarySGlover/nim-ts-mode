# Building nim-ts-mode


## Getting nim tree-sitter grammar to work with tree-sitter.el Emacs MELPA package

Because Emacs with built-in tree-sitter support does unfortunately not include treesit-query-builder,
we need to use an Emacs version without tree-sitter built-in, activate the tree-sitter layer in Spacemacs. Then we need to manually compile the Nim tree-sitter parser library by doing the following steps:

1. make sure that you did run `npm i -g tree-sitter-cli` to install tree-sitter-cli
2. run `tree-sitter-cli generate --abi 13` inside the tree-sitter-nim repository
3. run `cc -O2 -shared -Isrc -fPIC -o nim.so src/parser.c src/scanner.c` to create the nim.so tree-sitter parser library
4. move nim.so to /home/p0p3/.emacs.d/elpa/30.0/develop/tree-sitter-langs-20240107.149/bin/
5. call `tree-sitter-query-builder` inside Emacs after activating nim-ts-mode


## Further Emacs configuration to make nim-ts-mode work with lsp-mode

```elisp
  (setq treesit-language-source-alist
        '((nim "https://github.com/alaviss/tree-sitter-nim")))

  (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
    (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration
                 '(nim-ts-mode . "nim")))


  (require 'nim-ts-mode)
  (with-eval-after-load 'tree-sitter
    (add-to-list 'tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist '(nim-ts-mode . nim)))
```
